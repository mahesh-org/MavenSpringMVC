Size.student.studentHobby = Please enter a value between {2} and {1} for the field {0}! - From Property file
//Placeholder {0} is always replaced dynamically by spring mvc with the name of the field. Ex : studnetHobby
//Placeholder {1},{2} .. {n} will be replaced with the argument values passed to the constraint annotation.
//IMP:Spring MVC uses alphabetical order of the arguments to decide. Ex: Min and Max. Max will be picked 1st.
